    "As Echo Engine's machine learning model grows in complexity and utility, migrating it to a cloud platform offers several advantages. These include easier collaboration, scalability, centralized access, version control, and the ability to deploy models for real-time or batch inference. This document explores major cloud service providers and recommends a suitable approach for Echo Engine.\n"
