## Approach for scrapping

The data collection scripts scrape data from two websites â€“ Free Sound and Xeno

You have to change the file directory "G:/sounds/owl_sounds.csv" to your local file directory where you want the files to be downloaded.
The Xeno files will be downloaded in the downloads directory.
The scrapping data files will also be downloaded to the download folder on your local desktop.
