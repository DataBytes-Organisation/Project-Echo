SOUND recordings
%X Open audio databases such as Xeno-Canto are widely used to build datasets to explore bird song repertoire or to train models for automatic bird sound classification by deep learning algorithms. However, such databases suffer from the fact that bird sounds are weakly labelled: a species name is attributed to each audio recording without timestamps that provide the temporal localization of the bird song of interest. Manual annotations can solve this issue, but they are time consuming, expert-dependent, and cannot run on large datasets. Another solution consists in using a labelling function that automatically segments audio recordings before assigning a label to each segmented audio sample. Although labelling functions were introduced to expedite strong label assignment, their classification performance remains mostly unknown. To address this issue and reduce label noise (wrong label assignment) in large bird song datasets, we introduce a data-centric novel labelling function composed of three successive steps: 1) time-frequency sound unit segmentation, 2) feature computation for each sound unit, and 3) classification of each sound unit as bird song or noise with either an unsupervised DBSCAN algorithm or the supervised BirdNET neural network. The labelling function was optimized, validated, and tested on the songs of 44 West-Palearctic common bird species. We first showed that the segmentation of bird songs alone aggregated from 10% to 83% of label noise depending on the species. We also demonstrated that our labelling function was able to significantly reduce the initial label noise present in the dataset by up to a factor of three. Finally, we discuss different opportunities to design suitable labelling functions to build high-quality animal vocalizations with minimum expert annotation effort. • Open audio databases provide unique information for ecological sciences. • However, most of them are weakly labelled with a risk of signal confusion. • A labelling function based on segmentation, featurization, and clustering is proposed. • A test on the Xeno-Canto database revealed a significant reduction of label error. • Unsupervised labelling can foster the use of audio archives.

%X Recent advances in birdsong detection and classification have approached a limit due to the lack of fully annotated recordings. In this paper, we present NIPS4Bplus, the first richly annotated birdsong audio dataset, that is comprised of recordings containing bird vocalisations along with their active species tags plus the temporal annotations acquired for them. Statistical information about the recordings, their species specific tags and their temporal annotations are presented along with example uses. NIPS4Bplus could be used in various ecoacoustic tasks, such as training models for bird population monitoring, species classification, birdsong vocalisation detection and classification.

%X Automated bioacoustics classification has received increasing attention from the research community in recent years due its cross-disciplinary nature and its diverse application. Applications in bioacoustics classification range from smart acoustic sensor networks that investigate the effects of acoustic vocalizations on species to context-aware edge devices that anticipate changes in their environment adapt their sensing and processing accordingly. The research described here is an in-depth survey of the current state of bioacoustics classification and monitoring. The survey examines bioacoustics classification alongside general acoustics to provide a representative picture of the research landscape. The survey reviewed 124 studies spanning eight years of research. The survey identifies the key application areas in bioacoustics research and the techniques used in audio transformation and feature extraction. The survey also examines the classification algorithms used in bioacoustics systems. Lastly, the survey examines current challenges, possible opportunities, and future directions in bioacoustics.

%X This book offers an overview of some recent advances in the Computational Bioacoustics methods and technology. In the focus of discussion is the pursuit of scalability, which would facilitate real-world applications of different scope and purpose, such as wildlife monitoring, biodiversity assessment, pest population control, and monitoring the spread of disease transmitting mosquitoes. The various tasks of Computational Bioacoustics are described and a wide range of audio parameterization and recognition tasks related to the automated recognition of species and sound events is discussed. Many of the Computational Bioacoustics methods were originally developed for the needs of speech, audio, or image processing, and afterwards were adapted to the requirements of automated acoustic recognition of species, or were elaborated further to address the challenges of real-world operation in 24/7 mode. The interested reader is encouraged to follow the numerous references and links to web resources for further information and insights. This book is addressed to Software Engineers, IT experts, Computer Science researchers, Bioacousticians, and other practitioners concerned with the creation of new tools and services, aimed at enhancing the technological support to Computational Bioacoustics applications.
