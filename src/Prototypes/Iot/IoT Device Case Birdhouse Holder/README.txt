This case was created in Fusion 360, of which a free version is available for students from Autodesk

This model requires two m2x6 machine screws and two m2 washers to affix the raspberry pi to the internal case.

It also requires one m4x10 machine screw to affix the internal case to the external.

Superglue is used to affix the holder to the outer case

I recommend print in ASA for UV resistance, however PLA should be fine and easier to print for those not yet familiar with 3d printers.

I painted the exterior with grey and brown paint to help camouflage it to the tree, to make it obscured and less of a target.
