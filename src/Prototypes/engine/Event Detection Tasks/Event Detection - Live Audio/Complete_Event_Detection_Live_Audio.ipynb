    "# Event Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve real-time event detection in Python, we have utilised the pyaudio library to capture live audio from the microphone and analyse the audio data to identify events or patterns. The detect_events function monitors the audio data and triggers an alert when the audio exceeds a predefined threshold. This enables the user to be promptly notified of detected events while the audio stream is being monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been tested and is ready to use to test any live event detection scenarios in engine (prior to using in Echonet).\n",
