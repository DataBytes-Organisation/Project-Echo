## Protocol for Storing your work in prototypes:

To keep the prototypes folder tidy, and to easily find the workbooks for each task, we will use a directory structure based on each task.

**You will find the following directories:**

- Additional Data Collection Tasks
- Augmentation Tasks
- Ensemble Learning Tasks
- Event Detection Tasks
- Transfer Learning Tasks

Create a new folder for your task within the appropriate directory. Name your folder based on the specific task.
