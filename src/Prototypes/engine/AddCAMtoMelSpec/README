# Files
CatTest - This is a CAM sample project from kaggle 
Data - This is the 5 species audio but I just reamain the folder and audios need to be downloaded from bucket 2
Model1 - This is the pre-trained model (empty folder because the size is too large to push it; Please use the notebook AddCAMel.ipynb to train data)
AddCAMel.ipynb - This is the main file using cv2(opencv)
AddCAMel-FromCat.ipynb - This is the main file using the CAM function from CatTest
ToMelSpe.ipynb - This is used to get the mel spectrogram from one audio
TestFunc.ipynb - This is the original source of CAM functions
