    "# Optimized Weather Event Classification Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This training pipeline is designed for processing audio data and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for audio classification. It specifically deals with weather-related audio data, transforming raw audio files into mel-spectrogram representations that are then used as input for the CNN. Below are the key components and steps involved in this pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio Data Loading and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - **Loading Audio**: Audio files are loaded with a defined sample rate.\n",
    "   - **Padding or Trimming**: Each audio is either padded or trimmed to a uniform length based on the specified duration to maintain consistency.\n",
    "   - **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion**: Converts audio into mel-spectrograms using parameters like FFT window size and hop length.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - **Spectrogram Resizing**: Spectrograms are resized to fit the model's input dimensions.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical labels into a one-hot encoding format suitable for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - **CNN Architecture**: The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. It ends with a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer.\n",
    "   - **Callbacks**: Includes model checkpointing, reducing learning rate on plateau, and early stopping to improve training efficiency and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - Applies transformations like rotation, width and height shift, zoom, etc., to artificially expand the training dataset, which helps improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training Execution**:\n",
    "   - Uses an image data generator to feed data into the model in batches, facilitating efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation and Saving**:\n",
    "   - The training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted to monitor the training process.\n",
    "   - The best-performing model is saved for later use in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the model is saved both in TensorFlow's SavedModel format and as an H5 file, ensuring it can be easily loaded for future predictions or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is built to handle specifically formatted audio data and is optimized for high performance in audio classification tasks related to weather phenomena.\n"

    "# Model Training Setup and Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code defines the training process, including data augmentation, training execution, and the use of callbacks to enhance model training. Each component is crafted to optimize the model's performance and handle the training process efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Callbacks:\n",
    "- **ModelCheckpoint**:\n",
    "  - Saves the model after every epoch if it shows improvement over the previous best model, based on validation loss (`val_loss`).\n",
    "  - `save_best_only=True` ensures that only the top-performing model is saved, optimizing storage and focusing on the best results.\n",
    "  - `mode='min'` specifies that the `val_loss` should minimize for improvement.\n",
    "- **ReduceLROnPlateau**:\n",
    "  - Reduces the learning rate when the validation loss has stopped improving.\n",
    "  - `factor=0.1` reduces the learning rate to 10% of its current value.\n",
    "  - `patience=10` waits for 10 epochs without improvement before reducing the learning rate.\n",
    "  - `min_lr=0.00001` sets a lower bound on the learning rate to prevent it from decreasing too much.\n",
    "  - `verbose=1` ensures messages about learning rate reduction are printed.\n",
    "- **EarlyStopping**:\n",
    "  - Stops training when the validation loss has not improved for a given number of epochs (`patience=20`).\n",
    "  - `restore_best_weights=True` ensures that the model's weights are reverted to the best encountered during training upon early stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Augmentation:\n",
    "- Uses `ImageDataGenerator` to artificially enhance the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying random transformations that include:\n",
    "  - `rotation_range=20`: Rotates images by up to 20 degrees.\n",
    "  - `width_shift_range=0.2` and `height_shift_range=0.2`: Shifts images along the width and height by up to 20% of their dimensions.\n",
    "  - `shear_range=0.2`: Applies shear transformations.\n",
    "  - `zoom_range=0.2`: Zooms into images by up to 20%.\n",
    "  - `horizontal_flip=True`: Flips images horizontally (not typically useful for audio data but included for completeness).\n",
    "  - `fill_mode='nearest'`: Uses the nearest pixels to fill in new pixels when applying transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Execution:\n",
    "- The model is trained using the `fit` method on batches of data provided by `train_generator`.\n",
    "- `epochs=100` sets the number of passes over the complete dataset.\n",
    "- The training and validation datasets are specified, and the aforementioned callbacks are utilized to monitor and optimize the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs:\n",
    "- `history`: Captures the training history, including metrics such as loss and accuracy for both training and validation phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This training configuration leverages modern techniques in machine learning to ensure that the model learns effectively from the augmented data, adapts to new challenges dynamically through callbacks, and stops at the optimal time to prevent overfitting.\n"

    "- `plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')`: Sets the title of the plot to \"Training and Validation Loss\" to indicate what the graph represents.\n",
    "- `plt.legend()`: Adds a legend to the plot, which helps in distinguishing between the training and validation loss lines.\n",
    "- `plt.show()`: Displays the plot. This function call ensures that the plot is rendered and shown to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "- **Visualization**: This plot is crucial for understanding how well the model is learning and generalizing over time. It helps in identifying patterns such as overfitting or underfitting based on the divergence or convergence of these two lines.\n",
