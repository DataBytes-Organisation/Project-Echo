    "# Optimized Weather Event Classification Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This training pipeline is designed for processing audio data and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for audio classification. It specifically deals with weather-related audio data, transforming raw audio files into mel-spectrogram representations that are then used as input for the CNN. Below are the key components and steps involved in this pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio Data Loading and Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - **Loading Audio**: Audio files are loaded with a defined sample rate.\n",
    "   - **Padding or Trimming**: Each audio is either padded or trimmed to a uniform length based on the specified duration to maintain consistency.\n",
    "   - **Mel-Spectrogram Conversion**: Converts audio into mel-spectrograms using parameters like FFT window size and hop length.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - **Spectrogram Resizing**: Spectrograms are resized to fit the model's input dimensions.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical labels into a one-hot encoding format suitable for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - **CNN Architecture**: The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. It ends with a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer.\n",
    "   - **Callbacks**: Includes model checkpointing, reducing learning rate on plateau, and early stopping to improve training efficiency and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - Applies transformations like rotation, width and height shift, zoom, etc., to artificially expand the training dataset, which helps improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training Execution**:\n",
    "   - Uses an image data generator to feed data into the model in batches, facilitating efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Evaluation and Saving**:\n",
    "   - The training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted to monitor the training process.\n",
    "   - The best-performing model is saved for later use in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the model is saved both in TensorFlow's SavedModel format and as an H5 file, ensuring it can be easily loaded for future predictions or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is built to handle specifically formatted audio data and is optimized for high performance in audio classification tasks related to weather phenomena.\n"

    "# Plotting Training and Validation Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "This code segment is used to visualize the training and validation loss over epochs, providing a graphical representation of the model's learning progress. Here's an overview of how it is structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation:\n",
    "- `plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training loss')`: Plots the training loss values stored in `history.history['loss']` across all epochs. This line adds a label \"Training loss\" to distinguish it in the plot.\n",
    "- `plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation loss')`: Similarly, this line plots the validation loss values from `history.history['val_loss']`, labeled as \"Validation loss\".\n",
    "- `plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')`: Sets the title of the plot to \"Training and Validation Loss\" to indicate what the graph represents.\n",
    "- `plt.legend()`: Adds a legend to the plot, which helps in distinguishing between the training and validation loss lines.\n",
    "- `plt.show()`: Displays the plot. This function call ensures that the plot is rendered and shown to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "- **Visualization**: This plot is crucial for understanding how well the model is learning and generalizing over time. It helps in identifying patterns such as overfitting or underfitting based on the divergence or convergence of these two lines.\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Allows developers and researchers to monitor the training process visually, making it easier to decide whether further training is necessary or if adjustments need to be made to the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    "- A line graph showing the loss on the vertical axis and the number of epochs on the horizontal axis. The training loss is typically shown in one color and the validation loss in another to clearly illustrate the differences and trends during the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is an essential part of machine learning model training, as it provides immediate visual feedback on the effectiveness and progression of the training regime.\n"

    "# Saving the Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code is dedicated to saving the trained model for later use, ensuring that all the training effort can be utilized effectively in practical applications. The model is saved in two different formats to provide flexibility in deployment and further usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation:\n",
    "- **Directory Setup**:\n",
    "  - `model_dir = \"weather_audio_detection_model\"`: Defines a string variable that specifies the directory name where the TensorFlow SavedModel will be stored.\n",
    "- **Save as TensorFlow SavedModel**:\n",
    "  - `tf.saved_model.save(model, model_dir)`: Saves the entire model in TensorFlow's SavedModel format, which includes the architecture, weights, and the training configuration. This format is ideal for serving via TensorFlow Serving and can be useful for further fine-tuning or transfer learning.\n",
    "- **Save as HDF5 File**:\n",
    "  - `model.save('WeatherAudioDetectionModel.h5')`: Saves the model as an HDF5 file, a versatile storage format that is widely used in data-intensive environments, which is particularly useful for loading the model in other Python environments and for integration with other Python-based tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "- **Versatility and Compatibility**: Saving the model in these two formats ensures that it can be easily integrated and deployed across different platforms and applications.\n",
    "- **Preservation**: These methods ensure the preservation of the model's state after training, allowing for easy replication of results and further analysis at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    "- Two files are generated and saved:\n",
    "  - A directory named `weather_audio_detection_model` containing the SavedModel.\n",
    "  - An HDF5 file named `WeatherAudioDetectionModel.h5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These saving methods are critical for the lifecycle of machine learning projects, providing the means to utilize trained models beyond the immediate environment in which they were trained.\n"
