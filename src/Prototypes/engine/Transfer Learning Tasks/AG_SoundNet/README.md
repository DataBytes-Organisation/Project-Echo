# Animal Noise Classification with Combined SoundNet and EfficientNet Models

This repository contains code for building a combined model for animal noise classification using a pre-trained SoundNet model and a pre-trained EfficientNetV2 model. The combined model takes both audio and image inputs to classify animal noises into different classes.

## Functions Summary

### 1. `build_soundnet_model()`
This function builds the SoundNet model and loads the weights from a provided model file (`sound8.npy`). It defines the architecture of the SoundNet model, including convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions. The pre-trained weights are loaded and set for each layer in the model.

### 2. `preprocess(audio)`
This function preprocesses the audio input for compatibility with the SoundNet model. It scales the audio values and reshapes the input to the required format.

### 3. `load_audio(audio_file)`
This function loads an audio file, resamples it to a sample rate of 22050 Hz (required for SoundNet), and preprocesses it using the `preprocess()` function.

### 4. `build_model(trainable)`
This function builds a classification model using a pre-trained EfficientNetV2 model as a feature generator. It defines the architecture of the classification model, including input layers, feature extraction using EfficientNetV2, batch normalization, fully connected layers, and dropout. The model can be configured to have trainable layers or not.

### 5. `build_combined_model(trainable_efficientnet)`
This function builds the combined model by integrating the SoundNet and EfficientNetV2 models. It takes both audio and image inputs, extracts features separately from each model, concatenates these features, and passes them through additional layers for classification. The combined model outputs class probabilities for animal noise classification.

## Usage
To use these functions for animal noise classification, follow these steps:

1. Load an audio file using the `load_audio()` function to prepare the audio input.

2. Load an image for visual context, if available.

3. Use the `build_combined_model()` function to create the combined model, passing the `trainable_efficientnet` parameter to control whether the EfficientNetV2 layers are trainable.

4. Compile and train the combined model on your dataset.

5. Use the trained model for inference to classify animal noises based on both audio and visual features.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- NumPy
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- TensorFlow Hub (for EfficientNetV2 model)

Make sure to have these dependencies installed to run the code successfully.

# This approach was unsuccesful

This repository was initially intended to combine our existing model for animal noise classification with a pre-trained SoundNet model. However, this solution encountered limitations due to significant differences in the input requirements and output structure between the SoundNet model and our existing model.

**Issues Encountered:**

1. **Input Incompatibility:** The pre-trained SoundNet model expects audio data in a different format and resolution than our existing model. SoundNet works with raw audio waveforms, while our model likely uses a different audio representation.

2. **Fixed Output Structure:** SoundNet has a fixed output of 32 classes, which may not align with the class structure used in our existing model.

**Recommended Approach:**

To implement a more effective solution for animal noise classification, consider the following steps:

1. **Convert Existing Model to Python:** If your existing model is written in Lua, consider converting it to Python using popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. This will ensure that both models can be seamlessly integrated.

2. **Create a Unified Model:** Once both models are in Python, you can design a unified model that combines the audio and image features for classification. This custom model can have a flexible output structure that matches your specific class requirements.

3. **Training:** Train the unified model on your dataset, ensuring that the audio and image inputs are properly preprocessed and fed into the model during training.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the combined model on a validation dataset to fine-tune its hyperparameters and assess its ability to classify animal noises accurately.

5. **Inference:** After training, use the combined model for inference to classify animal noises based on both audio and visual features.
