This is a brief instruction to guide you to use the files in this folder.

These files are used to scrape the Australian birds' names from the website and filter out the birdcall from another data source like BirdCLEF 2023. I've already attached the CSV files you need when filtering out the sound from the Kaggle BirdCLEF 2023 data source. You can replace the path with your own in the Filter.py and run it directly to source the additional birdcall data. The steps below are useful when you want to source addtional data from other databases.

First you need to import the package using command "pip install [package name]"

For crawler.py, this is a python crawler to scrape the scientific names of all birds habitat in Australia. The website I used to gather names is "https://www.ozanimals.com/australian-bird-index/genus.html". If you want to use it to scrape data from other websites, you might need to make slight modifications on the method "extract_scientific_names" in this file to make it find the birds names on the websites you want. After running this file, it will generate a CSV file that contains all of the birds' names.

Then, we will use the extract_matching_names.py. This python script is used to compare between the two CSV files, one is the CSV file of the data source you want to filter, the other one is the CSV file generated by the crawler.py. It will match the names and also generate a CSV file. It will show you which species of birds are contained in your data source.

At last, we use the CSV file from the step 2 to filter out the data from the data source. Ceate a new folder for the filtered files and replace the path with your own in the Filter.py and run it. It will automatically filter out the folders that contain the matching species of birds and copy the files to your target directory. And you can use these additional data from other data source to your own data bucket for training.
