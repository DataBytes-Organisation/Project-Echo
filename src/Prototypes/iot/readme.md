<h1> Radio comms prototyping</h1>

<h2>Experiments with Lora</h2>

For project Echo, the end goal of the project is to collect real world audio from remote locations, to track and monitor animal movements in certain locations.  Remote access is hard, especially when transporting data or processing ML based decisions on the edge.  This component of the project seeks to find a suitable RF solution for the transmission of this data, and help understand the boundaries of what is possible on small low power devices.

In the first instance, we have two units, a Radio-Microphone which simulates one of the numerous capture devices, and a radio-gateway, which collects RF messages from the nodes and forwards them through another medium to a cloud based server.

Instructions for setting up these devices for experimentation using your own equipment will be developed in due course.
