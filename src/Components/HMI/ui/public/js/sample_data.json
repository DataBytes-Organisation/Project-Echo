            "The Swift parrot is mainly green with a bluish crown and red on the face above and below the beak. It is about 25 cm long, has long pointed wings and long tapering tail feathers. The adult female is slightly duller, and the juvenile has a dark brown iris and a pale orange bill.",
            "The species is critically endangered, with a population of fewer than 300 individuals. Habitat destruction due to logging and predation by introduced sugar gliders are the major threats to its survival.",
            "Swift parrots are nomadic migrants, settling in an area only when food is available. They are noisy, always active and showy, and have a very direct flight. The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) is a broad-tailed parrot species native to southeastern Australia.",
            "The species was first described by the surgeon John White in 1790 as the red-shouldered paroquet (Psittacus discolor). It was later placed in the genus Lathamus by René Primevère Lesson in 1830.",
            "A 2011 genetic study found that the swift parrot diverged from a lineage giving rise to the genera Prosopeia, Eunymphicus and Cyanoramphus, around 14 million years ago."

As well as the nominate race Lichmera indistincta indistincta, a number of other subspecies are recognised: ocularis, melvillensis, limbatus and nupta. The Indonesian honeyeater (subspecies limbatus) was previously considered a distinct species but is now treated as a subspecies of L. indistincta by major taxonomic authorities.",
