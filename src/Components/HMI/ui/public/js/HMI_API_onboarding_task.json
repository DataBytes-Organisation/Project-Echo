Measuring approximately 45 centimetres in length, it is predominantly black with notable red eyes and a slightly down-curved beak. A prominent feature is the large white wing patches visible during flight. These birds are highly social, typically observed in family groups ranging from 4 to 20 individuals. They are ground foragers, feeding on insects, seeds, and occasionally small vertebrates. White-winged choughs construct large, bowl-shaped nests from mud, reinforced with grass, situated on horizontal tree branches up to 15 meters above the ground. Breeding is a communal effort, with all group members participating in incubation and chick-rearing. While they may resemble crows or ravens, white-winged choughs are distinguished by their red eyes, curved beaks, and the characteristic white wing patches. Their social structure and cooperative breeding behaviours are notable aspects of their ecology."

Measuring between 13 to 17 centimetres in length and weighing around 22 grams, it exhibits predominantly dark brown plumage with a distinctive white throat and chest. The belly and flanks are streaked with white edged in black. Notably, females display a pale orange-brown patch on the cheek. These birds inhabit wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests, often observed climbing tree trunks in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of insects, especially ants, and occasionally nectar. Unlike other treecreepers, the white-throated treecreeper does not engage in cooperative breeding. The female constructs a cup-shaped nest within a tree cavity, where she lays two to three creamy-white eggs sparsely spotted with dark purple or red brown. While the female incubates the eggs, both parents participate in feeding the chicks until they fledge. The species is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, indicating a stable population across its range."

It inhabits arid and semi-arid environments, often near desert areas, and is commonly seen around small rural towns and agricultural lands. Measuring between 38 to 45 centimetres in length, the little crow is slightly smaller than the Torresan crow, with a proportionally smaller bill. Its plumage is entirely black with a glossy sheen, and it possesses white irises—a characteristic feature of Australian crow species. When ruffled by strong winds, white bases of the neck and head feathers become visible. These birds are omnivorous, feeding mainly on insects, cereals, and other seeds, primarily foraging on the ground. They are less scavenging compared to other Australian crow species. Little crows typically nest in small, loose colonies, constructing stick nests lined with mud—the only Australian corvid known to do so. The call of the little crow is characterized by a harsh \"hark-hark-hark-hark\" sound, and they also produce a more raven-like \"ah-ah-ah.\""

                "The Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) is a prominent bird species native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring between 46 to 53 centimetres in length, it displays all-black plumage with a glossy sheen that can appear purple, blue, or green under certain lighting conditions. A distinctive feature of this species is its elongated throat feathers, known as hackles, which become prominent when the bird is calling. Adult Australian ravens have white irises, while juveniles possess dark brown irises that gradually lighten as they mature. These ravens are highly adaptable and inhabit a wide range of environments, including open woodlands, forests, agricultural areas, and urban settings. They are commonly observed in cities such as Sydney and Perth. Their diet is omnivorous, consisting of grains, fruits, insects, small animals, eggs, refuse, and carrion. However, the Australian raven is mainly carnivorous. The Australian raven is known for its distinctive call, which often ends with a long, drawn-out wail. This vocalization, along with their prominent throat hackles, aids in distinguishing them from other corvid species in Australia"

                "The little raven (Corvus mellori) is a bird species native to southeastern Australia. Measuring approximately 48 to 50 centimetres in length, it features entirely black plumage, beak, and legs. Adult birds are distinguished by striking white irises, while juveniles have blue-grey eyes that transition to brown and then hazel before reaching maturity. These ravens are highly adaptable, inhabiting a variety of environments, including scrublands, agricultural areas, woodlands, coastal regions, and urban suburbs. They are particularly prevalent in Adelaide and Melbourne, often forming large flocks that roam widely in search of food. The little raven is omnivorous, with a diet primarily consisting of insects, small birds, eggs, nestlings, small mammals, and carrion. They also consume seeds, fruits, other plant materials, and occasionally nectar. Foraging mainly occurs on the ground in open habitats, where they walk and glean food or snatch prey from foliage."
