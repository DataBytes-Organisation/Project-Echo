Run docker-compose up -d in your terminal to build the Docker image and start the HiveMQ MQTT broker.
Once the HiveMQ MQTT broker is running, you can use the following URLs to interact with it:

To send and receive messages, connect your MQTT client to mqtt://localhost:1883. 

To access the HiveMQ Control Center, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 - here you can track all incoming and outgoing messages
