    "The following sets up callbacks to track model training and performs the model fit to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The callbacks will ensure the best model weights (as defined by lowest validation loss) will be written to disk during training.  This is important as the model training could take several hours (12+ hours) to complete and any errors may cause the training loop to exit - so having the checkpoints acts as a backup.  The model will stop training when it sees no further improvement to the validation loss, after which it will restore the best weights found.  This allows the training to discover when it is overfit and stop further training.  This is why the number of epics is 10000.  It is expected the model training will end significantly earlier than this."
